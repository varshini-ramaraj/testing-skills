Written for the 2023 AR workshop for Coupa, Ann Arbor.
The main branch contains tests with WIP code, while the cheatsheet branch contains notes on the work that needs to be done, as well as some of the test stubs written out during the actual presentation.

Future work:
Some feedback was given about cleaning it up for helping the context switch be better for folks seeing the repo for the first time on a screen. May do that if I ever decide to reuse this repo
