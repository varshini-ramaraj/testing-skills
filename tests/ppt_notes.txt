How about nice to have's vs bugs



Bugs
- Allowing for Nones/Nulls in latitude/longitude
- Actually implementing calculate costs (includes searching for source/destination/products)
- Standardizing string values of source/destination/product, especially for comparison
- Allow for Nones/Nulls in weight and volume
- Should we allow for Nones in cost unit cost lol? That feels besides the point

Not a bug but should have
- allowing the flow to not initialize all four of them together, but does it separately in each concern
- also doesnt do it in initializer, but waits for a call
- Use Mock for returning values


Nice to have
- variable-izing the dictionary keys
- Changing the initializer of fake model creator, rather than changing the data in data_reader
- Changing the initializer of fake model creator, than model going through all that its going through
- Calling the float or default of lat/long in its own function than leaving it in the class call
- lack of type hinting changing to type hinting in the separate classes
- all the classes being moved out of the model_creator class
